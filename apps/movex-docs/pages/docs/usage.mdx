# Using Movex

Remeber, the state logic lives in the reducer, which only needs to be written once, at the client level, as if building a single player or front-end only app. Movex makes it possible to take the movex.js file, upload it on a server and run it as the authority, without you, the developer having to write any specific code or hooking up anything. _(Except setting up the Movex Backend Service or using a hosting provider. But this should only be done once)._

```ts
// counter.movex.ts

import { Action } from 'movex';

export type CounterState = {
  count: number;
};

export const initialCounterState: CounterState = {
  count: 0,
};

export type CounterActions =
  | Action<'increment'>
  | Action<'decrement'>
  | Action<'incrementBy', number>;

export default (state = initialCounterState, action: CounterActions) => {
  if (action.type === 'increment') {
    return {
      ...state,
      count: state.count + 1,
    };
  }

  if (action.type === 'decrement') {
    return {
      ...state,
      count: state.count - 1,
    };
  }

  if (action.type === 'incrementBy') {
    return {
      ...state,
      count: state.count + action.payload,
    };
  }

  return state;
};
```

Define the movex.config. This is where the movex reducers get assigned a resource type.

```ts
// This will be read by both the client and the server

import counterReducer from './counter.movex';

export default {
  resources: {
    counter: counterReducer,
  },
};
```

```ts
// App.ts
const movex = await new Promise((resolve) => {
  Client.initMovex(
    {
      clientId,
      url: props.socketUrl,
      apiKey: '',
    },
    resolve
  );
});

const conterResource = movex.registerResource(
  'counter',
  counterResourceReducer
);

// use it
const counterResourceIdentifier = conterResource.create();

// movex.resources is MovexResource({});
counterResource.onUpdated(counterResourceIdentifier, (nextState) => {
  console.log('got next state', nextState);
});
```
