# Deploying Movex

Event though you don't have to write any server specific code for Movex to work there still needs to be a server running the show. It's waht makes [Server-Authoritative](/docs/features/server_authoritative) possible.

### 1. Generic Deploying

_This example uses yarn, but you should change the installing commands to the prefered package manager._

1. Make sure the Cli (Movex-Service) is installed

```bash copy
yarn add --dev movex-service
```

2. Install all the project dependencies

```bash copy
yarn;
```

3. Serve it
```bash copy
npx movex serve
```

### 2. Via Docker

Here is a sample Dockerfile. You can paste it as is if you're using 'yarn' or change to accordingly to the package manager of your choice (lines 12-13).

```docker showLineNumbers copy {12-13}
FROM node:16-alpine as builder

ENV NODE_ENV build

# USER node
WORKDIR /home/node

COPY ./package*.json ./
COPY ./yarn.lock ./

# Install global deps
RUN apk add g++ make py3-pip git yarn
RUN rm -rf node_modules && yarn install --frozen-lockfile && yarn add movex-server movex-service

COPY --chown=node:node . .

CMD ["npx", "movex build"]

# RUN node build

# ---

FROM node:16-alpine

ENV NODE_ENV production

EXPOSE 3333

# USER node
WORKDIR /home/node

COPY --from=builder --chown=node:node /home/node/local ./local/
COPY --from=builder --chown=node:node /home/node/node_modules/ ./node_modules/
COPY --from=builder --chown=node:node /home/node/dist/ ./dist/
COPY --from=builder --chown=node:node /home/node/runner.js ./

ENTRYPOINT ["node", "runner.js"]
```

Also, make sure to map the Exposed PORT (i.e. 3333) to the desired port when you're running the built image. 

```bash copy
 docker run -d -p 3333:{MY_PORT}
```
